<pre><b>Title:</b> Feasible study on Intracranial hemorrhage detection and classification using a CNN-LSTM network in python programming language.
<br>
<b>Role:</b> Individual
<br>
<b>Language:</b> Python
<br>
<p><b>Description:</b> Intracranial hemorrhage is an internal bleeding in the brain which causes severe threat to human life, which mainly classified into five categories.
Training head CT images with the help of the model. Classing the hemorrhage type and computing the correctness of the model.</p></pre>

        <pre><b>Title:</b> Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Prediction using an Attentive Multi-Scale Deep Convolutional Neural Network.<br>
<b>Role:</b> Team lead<br>
<b>Language:</b> Python<br>
<p><b>Description:</b> Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disorder identified by the poor functionality of joints. A deep learning-based model is proposed to assess
the severity of OA in terms of grades which helps in further medical treatment without much loss.</p></pre>
